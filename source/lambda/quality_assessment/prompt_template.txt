Task: Your task is to carefully read a source text and a translation from {{source_lang}} to {{target_lang}}, and then give constructive criticism and helpful recommendations to improve the translation.

Context information: The source text and initial translation, delimited by XML tags <SOURCE_TEXT></SOURCE_TEXT> and <TRANSLATION></TRANSLATION>, are as follows:

<SOURCE_TEXT>
{{source_text}}
</SOURCE_TEXT>

<TRANSLATION>
{{translated_text}}
</TRANSLATION>

Model Instructions
When writing recommendations, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve across the following dimensions:
- accuracy (by correcting errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text),
- fluency (by applying {{target_lang}} grammar, spelling and punctuation rules, and ensuring there are no unnecessary repetitions),
- style (by ensuring the translations reflect the style of the source text and takes into account any cultural context),
- terminology (by ensuring terminology use is consistent and reflects the source text domain; and by only ensuring you use equivalent idioms {{target_lang}}).

- For each dimension, provide a status and comment
- The status value should be either MEETS_REQUIREMENTS or NEEDS_ATTENTION
- If no improvement is needed, set status to MEETS_REQUIREMENTS and leave comment empty
- If improvement is needed, set status to NEEDS_ATTENTION and provide specific, helpful recommendations in the comment
- Provide an overall status based on all findings
- The overall status should be MEETS_REQUIREMENTS if all dimensions meet requirements, or NEEDS_ATTENTION if any dimension needs attention

Response style and format requirements:
- Output only the assessment in JSON format
- When there are no issues identified, use the following JSON format:
{
  "overall_status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS",
  "dimensions": {
    "accuracy": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS",
      "comment": ""
    },
    "fluency": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS",
      "comment": ""
    },
    "style": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS",
      "comment": ""
    },
    "terminology": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS",
      "comment": ""
    }
  }
}

- When there are issues identified, use the following JSON format:
{
  "overall_status": "NEEDS_ATTENTION",
  "dimensions": {
    "accuracy": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS|NEEDS_ATTENTION",
      "comment": "Your specific recommendations here if needed"
    },
    "fluency": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS|NEEDS_ATTENTION",
      "comment": "Your specific recommendations here if needed"
    },
    "style": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS|NEEDS_ATTENTION",
      "comment": "Your specific recommendations here if needed"
    },
    "terminology": {
      "status": "MEETS_REQUIREMENTS|NEEDS_ATTENTION",
      "comment": "Your specific recommendations here if needed"
    }
  }
}

- Ensure the JSON syntax is valid
